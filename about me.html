            I would like to start off by saying thank you for visiting my website.<br>
            My name is McCall Manyor, I am currently finishing up my Senior year at the University of Tennessee in Chattanooga.<br>
        </p>

            When everything got shut down in 2020 due to the global pandemic, I started baking to pass time. During this time I was able to prefect my craft and learn how to make more items.<br>
            I shared many items that are on this website with family and friends
