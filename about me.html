            Welcome to the about me page!<br>
            Here you will learn about me, McCall, and how I got into baking.

        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>
            A little sweetness in every bite.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I would like to start off by saying thank you for visiting my website.<br>
            My name is McCall Manyor, I am currently finishing up my Senior year at the University of Tennessee in Chattanooga.
        </p>

        <p>
            When everything got shut down in 2020 due to the global pandemic, I started baking to pass time. During this time I was able to prefect my craft while learning how to make more items.
            I shared many items that are on this website with family and friends and they enjoyed every spoonful. They are the ones who inspired me to start this business.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The plan for the future of this business is to grow slightly bigger but not too big to where it is my main focus. I would love to keep it as a side job that still brings in a great profit but doesnt feel like I am actually working.
